## Piece Movement

### ♔ King
- Moves **1 square** in any direction (up, down, left, right, diagonal)

- Cannot move into danger or adjacent to opponent's king

### ♕ Queen
- Moves **any number of squares** in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- **Most powerful piece** - can reach almost any square
- Cannot jump over other pieces

### ♖ Rook
- Moves **any number of squares** horizontally or vertically
- Powerful for controlling rows and columns
- Cannot jump over other pieces

### ♗ Bishop

### ♘ Knight
- Moves in an **L-shape:** 2 squares in one direction + 1 square perpendicular

## Game Rules

### Taking Turns

1. **White moves first** (always)
2. Players alternate: White → Black → White → ...
3. You must move one piece per turn

### Capturing Pieces

- Move your piece to a square with an opponent's piece to **capture** it
- The opponent's piece is removed from the board
- **Cannot capture your own pieces**

### Check ⚠️

- Your king is **in check** when an opponent's piece threatens to capture it
- **You must escape check immediately:**
  - Move your king away
  - Block with another piece
  - Capture the attacking piece
- Illegal moves (that leave king in check) are not allowed

### Legal Moves

- Highlighted **green squares** show where your selected piece can legally move
- **Light green:** Peaceful move (no capture)
- **Red highlighted:** Squares where you can capture opponent's pieces

---

## Special Moves

### ♙ Pawn Promotion

When a **pawn reaches the far end** of the board:
- A dialog appears asking which piece to promote to
- **Choose wisely:** Usually upgrade to a **Queen** (most powerful)
- Other options: Rook, Bishop, Knight
- The pawn is removed and replaced with your choice

### Captured Pieces Display

- **Left panel:** Black pieces captured by White
- **Right panel:** White pieces captured by Black
- Helps you track material advantage

## Winning & Losing

### ✅ Checkmate (You Win!)

- Opponent's king is in **check** AND has **no legal moves**
- Game ends immediately
- The app displays: **"[Your Color] wins by checkmate"**

### 🤝 Stalemate (Draw)

- Opponent is **NOT in check** but has **no legal moves**
- Game ends as a draw
- The app displays: **"Draw by stalemate"**

### Piece Values (For Strategy)

- Pawn = 1 point
- Knight = 3 points
- Bishop = 3 points
- Rook = 5 points
- Queen = 9 points
- King = Priceless! (Don't lose it)

## Tips for Beginners

### Opening (First Few Moves)

1. **Control the center** - Occupy middle squares for flexibility
2. **Develop pieces** - Get knights and bishops into play
3. **Protect your king** - Don't leave it exposed early
4. **Don't rush** - Think ahead before moving

### Middle Game Strategy

1. **Look before you move** - Check all opponent's pieces can't capture yours
2. **Trade fairly** - Don't give away valuable pieces for cheaper ones
3. **Create threats** - Attack opponent pieces and squares simultaneously
4. **Protect your pieces** - Never leave pieces undefended

### Endgame (Few Pieces Left)

1. **King becomes active** - Use it to attack and defend
2. **Pawn promotion is key** - Push pawns toward victory
3. **Rooks and Queens dominate** - Use them to control board
4. **Watch for checkmate patterns** - Force opponent into corners

### Common Beginner Mistakes ❌

- ❌ Moving pieces without checking if opponent can capture
- ❌ Ignoring opponent's threats
- ❌ Losing your queen early for no reason
- ❌ Leaving king unprotected in the center
- ❌ Promoting pawn to anything but Queen (usually)

### How to Get Better ✅

- ✅ Play multiple games against AI
- ✅ Think 2-3 moves ahead
- ✅ Learn basic opening moves
- ✅ Practice recognizing checkmate patterns
- ✅ Try harder difficulty levels

## Game Modes

### 👥 Human vs Human
- Play against another person on the same device
- Each player takes turns clicking pieces
- **Timer:** 10 minutes per player (optional speed test)
- Perfect for learning with friends

### 🤖 Human vs Bot
- Play against the AI chess engine
- Choose bot difficulty:
  - **Easy:** Basic moves, mistakes often
  - **Medium:** Balanced play, good for practice
  - **Hard:** Strong strategy, wins often
- **No timer** in AI mode - take your time!
- Bot plays as either White or Black (you choose)

### Piece Set Selection
Choose from 10 different visual styles:
- Staunton, Wood, Metal, Glass, and more
- Doesn't affect gameplay, just aesthetics

## Keyboard & Mouse Controls

### Special Actions
- **Back to Menu** button → returns to piece selection screen

---

## Last Move Highlight 🟨

- After each move, the **from** and **to** squares are highlighted in yellow
- Helps you track the most recent move (yours or AI's)
- Clears when the next move is made

---

## Captured Pieces Tracking 📦

- **Top left panel (Black Captures):** Shows white pieces captured by black
- **Top right panel (White Captures):** Shows black pieces captured by white
- Helps evaluate who's winning materially
- 5 pawns = 5 points, Queen = 9 points, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't move my piece!"

**Possible reasons:**
1. It's not your turn (timer shows opponent's turn)
2. Move would leave your king in check (illegal)
3. No legal moves available from that position
4. Game is over (checkmate/stalemate)

### "Where's the checkmate option?"

- **Automatic!** When checkmate happens, game ends and displays winner
- You can't move after checkmate - click "Back to Menu" to start new game

### "Why is AI so fast?"

- AI doesn't need thinking time for easy/medium
- Hard mode takes 1-2 seconds (normal, it's calculating)
- This is intentional - gives you time to see moves
